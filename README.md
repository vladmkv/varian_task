# Overview

The Sushi module implements required functionality.

The SushiTests module contains unit tests which also serve as usage samples.

There is no demo application since I think tests should demo all the implemented functionality quite well.

The highest-level functionality is excercised by:
* `CheckoutStrategySelectorTest`: Use Case detection based on ordered plates and time
* `SoupMenuCheckoutTest`, `FivePlateMenuCheckoutTest`: optimized calculation of order price

Solution was created and edited in VS2022 and targeted to .NET Core 6
